# hangman
This is Trilogy Ed homework: hangman game.  It's an experiment written in vanilla JavaScript.  I'm providing this repo for a class demonstration of what an acceptable homework submission looks like.  Feel free to do more or less as you see fit.

## rules and requirements
1. The app randomly picks a word, and the user has to guess what it is letter by letter.

2. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

3. Display the following on the page:

4. Press any key to get started!

5. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

   * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

   * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

6. Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

7. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).

8. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
